        <strong>Velaris</strong>, also known as the <em>Court of Dreams</em>, is a hidden faerie city nestled against the Sidra River and flanked by towering red mountains.

        Visitors step into a vibrant, artist-friendly haven sculpted of white marble and warm sandstone.
        While long kept secret by powerful enchantments, today Velaris dazzles travelers with its art, culture, and gentle beauty.

    <p> The city can be divided into several distinct districts and points of interest, all worth a visit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rainbow of Velaris (Arts District): </strong></li>The most famous quarter is the Rainbow – a brightly painted artists’ quarter on a hillside by the Sidra. Home to roughly a hundred galleries, studios and sculpture gardens, this neighborhood buzzes with music, dance and painters at work. You’ll find golden-roofed theaters (including the city’s largest theater) and an open-air amphitheater clinging to a sea cliff. Galleries like Aranea’s Gallery (tapestries and crafts) line the streets, and local artisans (even Feyre’s own studio) offer creative workshops.
            <li><strong>Four Market Palaces: </strong></li> Velaris features four grand squares – called Palaces – filled with markets and shops. The Palace of Thread and Jewels sells fine silks and jewelry, the Palace of Bone and Salt offers the best local foods and spices, and twin squares like Palace of Hoof and Leaf host everything from riding gear to herbal wares. White-stoned plazas with carved pillars and covered arcades make these markets a feast for the eyes as well as the wallet.
            <li><strong>Sidra River & Waterfront: </strong></li> The sapphire Sidra River winds through Velaris, dotted with sailboats and lined by promenades. Stroll along its banks under blooming lemon-verbena trees (legend says Rhysand infused the river’s magic with his own blood to hide the city) and enjoy views of white-sand beaches and red cliffs. Boat rides are popular – tourists often take small sailboats or gondolas to see the city from the water. On the far side of the Sidra, gardens and harbors welcome visitors to relax in waterside cafés or meditate by the shore.
            <li><strong>House of Wind (High Lord’s Mountain Home): </strong></li> Perched high in the flat-topped mountains north of Velaris is the House of Wind. Carved into the rock with golden spires that glitter by lantern light, this is Rhysand’s official residence and the Night Court headquarters. Its many balconies and training terraces crown the peak, offering spectacular starlit views. This House is only accessible by two means: flight or the sheer physical exertion of its 10.000 steps.
            <li><strong>Rita’s House: </strong></li>For nightlife, Rita’s is legendary. This fairy “tavern” (more a lavish nightclub) features music, dancing and games late into the night. Colorfully lit and LGBTQ-friendly, Rita’s draws all walks of Velaris society. It’s a place to see lively dance shows or learn local folk dances under magical lantern light.
