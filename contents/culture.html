    Velaris&#39; culture is defined by art, freedom and hidden sanctuary. According to legend, an ancient Night Court High Lord envisioned a safe haven for dreamers away from political turmoil.
    He <i>sealed</i> the city with powerful spells (rumored to use his own blood on the stones and river) so that no outsider would discover it. For millennia Velaris was spoken of as nothing but myth. High Lord Rhysand continued this legacy: during Amarantha&#39;s reign he acted the tyrant in the Hewn City while secretly shielding Velaris. The city&#39;s existence was only revealed to mortals during the War of Hybern.

    For the purposes of the user&#39;s tourism webpage, bridging the gap between the fictional Sidra and the real world requires a close examination of the <b>Matter Vispa</b> in <b>Zermatt, Switzerland</b>.
    While the Sidra is deep and navigable by ships, the Matter Vispa is a glacial torrent, often milky with rock flour. However, the atmosphere is identical. Both rivers carve through a valley flanked by steep hills and mountains, creating a corridor of sound and light that defines the town&#39;s ambience.

    After the war, Velaris emerged from the shadow. Today its residents rebuild any remaining damage while preserving their secret enchantments. Visitors find a cheerful, open society: Velaris is renowned as a tolerant utopia. People often note that Velaris was <b>"built to be viewed during the night"</b>
    &ndash; by day its white buildings glitter, and by night its spires glow under the stars. History lives on in the city&#39;s architecture and festivals, and every street hums with the legacy of the Court of Dreams.
