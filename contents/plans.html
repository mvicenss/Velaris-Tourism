        <li><b>Art and Workshops:</b></li>As a city of artists, Velaris offers countless creative experiences. Visitors can tour famed galleries (Aranea&#39;s, Ressina&#39;s studios, Feyre&#39;s gallery) and even take art classes. After the war the Inner Circle reopened free painting workshops in the Rainbow, so travelers often join in portrait classes led by Night Court artists. Street art fairs and impromptu poetry slams are common on the cliffs above the Sidra.
        <li><b>Performances & Theater:</b></li> Velaris &#39; <b> thater district</b> puts on nightly performances. The cliffside amphitheater hosts orchestral concerts and spring festivals under the open sky. In the Rainbow quarter you can catch plays, ballets and musical ensembles in several opera houses (including the famous golden-domed theatre). There are also midsize venues for cabarets and poetry readings.
        <li><b>Dining & Tea:</b></li> The city is dotted with cafés and restaurants. A favorite is the <b> Riverside Restaurant</b> (often just called “the Restaurant”), known for its green-and-gold decor and afternoon tea by the water. 
        Markets have street vendors selling mulled wine and sweet rolls. For a fine dining experience, visit <b> Sevenda</b>, the pinnacle of Velarisian fine dining. Owned by chef Sevenda, the restaurant is famous for its menu and atmosphere.
        <li><b>Nightlife & Festivals:</b></li> Life after dark is vibrant. Besides dancing at Rita&#39;s, Velaris hosts seasonal festivals. The most famous is <b> Starfall</b>, a springtime celebration when the night sky is lit by dancing faerie spirits. Everyone turns off their lights and gathers on the House of Wind balconies to watch the spectacle. (Insider tip: Rhysand famously hosted a Starfall ball there). In winter, the Yule Solstice feast and summer water-fights on the Sidra keep the fun coming.
        <li><b>Nature & Views:</b></li> Beyond the city walls, many visitors hike or fly to viewpoints. The flat-topped Illyrian mountains offer panoramic views of Velaris at dawn. Cliffs above the Sidra are popular for a quiet picnic or stargazing (locals say Velaris&#39; breeze smells of lemon-verbena). Boat tours on the Sidra itself give a “sea-to-sky” view of the city’s white-marble buildings and the golden House of Wind afar. If you fancy a good hike, the <b> Illyrian Steppes</b> or the <b>Mount Ramiel</b>
        are great for testing your endurance, but keep in mind that the views you&#39;ll encounter at the top are
