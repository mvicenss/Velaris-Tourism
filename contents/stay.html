    Velaris is small and magical enough that there are no large inns named in canon — guests usually stay with friends or in modest taverns. <b>Wolf&#39;s Den Inn</b> is the most famous lodging for travellers (albeit infamously the <i>“worst tavern in Velaris”</i>); it offers basic rooms and hearty Illyrian ale — a rustic experience for adventurous souls. Wealthy guests, ambassadors, or Inner Circle friends might be invited to private homes: the elegant <b>Town House</b> has guest quarters for visiting officials, and <b>Feyre and Rhysand&#39;s riverside River House</b> (a sprawling manor) could, in theory, host family — though these are not open to the public. In practice, travellers seek rooms in small guesthouses or stay as guests of Velaris families. Magical wards mean you&#39;ll need an invitation or to be known to someone inside to gain access.
